<hr/>

The program allows you to take screenshots of the client area and export hardware information in the following formats:
- HTML (with CSS)
- XML
- Simple text

Supports the following operating systems:
- Windows Vista (x86/x64)
- Windows 7 (x86/x64)
- Windows 8/8.1 (x86/x64)
- Windows 10 (x86/x64)


Might also work on modern Windows Server systems, but I didn't test it.

The program is written in C/C++ and uses barebones WindowsAPI for it's GUI.

This program is free software.
